# ML for Material Science
<br>
##Introduction
This machine learning is one of the example of the utilization of ML in material science regime.
The purpose is to predict the superconductivity temperature of material, especially, known-as conventional superconductor.
Superconductor is a set of physical properties observed in certain materials where electrical resistance vanishes and magnetic flux fields are expelled from the material. This materials have various functionalities for instance, magnetic levitation train, quantum computers, etc.

The dataset itself was extracted from NIMS Database (https://dice.nims.go.jp/news/2021/12/20211221.html).
The daset consists of chemical compound and Tc (Temperature when the material start behaving as superconductor)
